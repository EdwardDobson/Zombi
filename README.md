# Project Info

This is an ongoing project you can see the progress by looking at the projects tab on this repo or looking at the releases. This project also allows me to learn more about how both blueprints and C++ code works in regards to UE4.

Feel free to download the source files or the build to try it out!

**Make sure to use Unreal 4.26 if you are using the source files.**
