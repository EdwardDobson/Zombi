# Overview
[Current Features](/docs/currentfeatures.md)

Jump pads allow the player to traverse the map more easily and opens up more level design options. When the jump pad has collided with the player I cast tp the Base Play which is the base class for the player, this allows me to get the players mesh so I can apply a force below it. This makes the player jump high into the air.
